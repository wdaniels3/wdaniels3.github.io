        <p>Willie Mack Daniels was born in Avon Park, Florida. Willie Mack met his mentor, Academy Award Nominee Sy Gomberg at a pivotal time in his life. With Mr. Gomberg‚Äôs support and mentorship, Willie attended the Prague Summer Writers Workshop in the now Czech Republic where he studied with Gomberg before his untimely death. Extremely appreciative, Willie was given the unique opportunity to travel throughout Europe to cities such as Rome, Milan, Munich, Dusseldorf, and Amsterdam. The experience proved to be a turning point in his life.</p>

        <p>Nearing the end of his second year of study, Willie received a fellowship from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Foundation in which fellows were also given an internship to gain hands-on experience in the field of their choosing. He chose to work in development at the Ruddy Morgan Organization. He was then selected as one of fifteen recipients of the Guy Alexander Hanks/Marvin Miller Screenwriting program sponsored by Dr. Bill and Camille Cosby.</p>

        <p>Eventually, Willie would enroll at Los Angeles City College in the Cinema-Television Department, where he directed two short films and then auditioned for the LACC Theater Academy Professional Actor Training Program. Near the end of his first year, he was presented with the Most Outstanding Actor Award. After graduation, Willie signed on with a Manager; and shortly thereafter, he was hired as a writer on the independent feature, The Nephew, starring Pierce Brosnan, Donal McCann, and Hill Harper. Afterward, he co-wrote a screenplay entitled The Ransdall Report, which was among the top 10% of the Nicholl Screenwriting Competition and he was selected for the prestigious Film Independent Project: Involve Fellowship. Willie is no longer working in the entertainment field and now he enjoys commercials as a hobby.</p>
